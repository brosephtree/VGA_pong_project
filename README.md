# VGA_pong_project

OVERVIEW

The objective of this project is to use a VGA monitor to play a 2-player Pong game.  The project uses a combination of tile-mapped and object-mapped schemes to generate entities.

TECHNOLOGY

This project is optimized for implementation on a Basys 3 board, which uses an Artix-7 FPGA from Xilinx. The Basys 3 includes enough switches, buttons, and other I/O devices necessary for the project.  Furthermore, this project uses a VGA monitor capable of 640x480p at 60fps, which is connected to the Basys 3 board via 15-pin VGA cable.
